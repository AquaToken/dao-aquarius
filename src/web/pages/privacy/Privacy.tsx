            security of your Personal Data against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure,
            and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls, data encryption, physical
            access controls to our data centers, and information access authorization controls. We
            do not guarantee or warrant that such techniques will prevent unauthorized access to
            information about you that we store, Personal Data or otherwise.
