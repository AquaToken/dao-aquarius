            <span>
                Governance allows for creating and discussing potential changes to the Aquarius
                protocol. AQUA holders can create proposals and start community discussions before
                deciding whether to publish proposals for a vote.

            <span>
                To start the process, click the <b>Create Discussion</b> button. Provide all
                necessary information, including the title, Discord information, and proposal
                content. Ensure you give as much detail as possible, especially the implementation
                plan.

        question: 'What is a discussion?',
        answer: (
            <span>
                Before a proposal can be published, discussions must take place. The mandatory 7 day
                discussion phase allows for gathering feedback and more in-depth talks between
                proposal creators and the wider AQUA community.

        question: 'Can I edit a proposal?',
        answer: (
            <span>
                Creators can edit proposals up to 30 days after creation. Editing can be necessary
                if the initial proposal isnâ€™t clear or any changes are put forward in the discussion
                phase. Stronger proposals are more likely to pass.

        question: 'How to publish a proposal?',

                After 7 days of discussions, creators can publish their proposals for a vote.
                Creators will only see the <b>Publish</b> option once the minimum discussion phase
                has passed.

                A fee of <b>{formatBalance(CREATE_DISCUSSION_COST)} AQUA is needed to create</b> a
                proposal discussion. To move a discussion to the publishing phase requires a further{' '}

                {formatBalance(CREATE_DISCUSSION_COST)} AQUA, so ensure proposals are thoroughly
                thought out & complete before submitting.
