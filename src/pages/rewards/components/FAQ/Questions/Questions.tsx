                        An AQUA trustline needs to be added to the user's Stellar wallet. Trustlines
                        allow a user to receive & hold specific Stellar assets within their wallets.
                        Once a user has a Stellar wallet and an AQUA trustline enabled they can
                        start earning rewards through SDEX market making or AMM liquidity providing.

                    <span>
                        SDEX rewards are earned through market making on the above markets on
                        Stellar Decentralized Exchange (SDEX). Market making happens through the
                        creation of buy & sell offers, with orders sitting on the order books ready
                        for other users to take at a later time. For SDEX market making you can use
                        platforms like LOBSTR, StellarX, StellarTerm or market-making bots like Kelp
                        bot.

                answer={
                    <span>
                        AMM rewards are earned through liquidity providing on the above markets
                        through Stellar AMMs. These rewards are distributed based on a user's
                        contribution to AMM pools. You can get access to AMMs on Stellar using
                        products like StellarX, Stellarport, or Lumenswap.
