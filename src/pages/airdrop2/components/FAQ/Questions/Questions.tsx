                        The snapshot was taken on January 15, 2022 at 00:00:00 UTC (at the Stellar
                        ledger 39185028). We took into account the amount of XLM, yXLM and AQUA held
                        by wallets to determine their airdrop reward. Those who locked AQUA inside
                        the locker tool received a boost to their airdrop reward.

                        On December 6, the AQUA community voted to pass proposal 19, moving the
                        snapshot date to January 15, 2022. You can learn more on our Gov page{' '}

                        If you held XLM on an eligible exchange, you typically didn't need to do
                        anything. Participating exchanges will distribute AQUA to users in
                        proportion to their XLM holdings at the time of the snapshot. Users of
                        participating exchanges didn't need to hold AQUA to participate and could
                        typically hold less than 500 XLM to be eligible.

                        Please use the airdrop checker tool to find out the expected amount of AQUA
                        your wallet will receive during the 3 year distribution. Your final reward
                        took into consideration how many other people participated, the amount of
                        XLM/yXLM and AQUA that you held at the time of the snapshot, and whether or
                        not you locked AQUA for the snapshot.
