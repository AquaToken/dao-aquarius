                        Although originally used to boost Airdrop #2 rewards, the locker tool now
                        turns AQUA into ICE. Those who freeze AQUA through this tool receive 4 ICE
                        tokens in return, each of which has a specific use within the Aquarius
                        universe.

                question={'What are the benefits of freezing AQUA?'}
                answer={
                    <span>
                        Freezing AQUA into ICE comes with multiple benefits.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        ICE tokens, unlike AQUA, can be used simultaneously on liquidity voting &
                        governance voting. Voting restrictions are also removed, with users able to
                        change their liquidity votes anytime and able to retrieve their ICE
                        immediately after a governance proposal ends.

                answer={
                    <span>
                        Yes! Holding ICE can increase the rewards given to those who take part in
                        SDEX & AMM liquidity rewards.

                        <br />
                        The more ICE an account holds, the higher the potential rewards boost given
                        for liquidity provision on selected markets. Markets eligible for liquidity
                        rewards can be found at{' '}

                answer={
                    <span>
                        To get more ICE, you need to either lock more AQUA or choose a longer lock
                        period when locking AQUA.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Users can gain up to ten times the amount of ICE compared to the AQUA they
                        lock by locking for longer. To achieve the 10 times max boost, users need to
                        lock AQUA for 3 years or longer.

                answer={
                    <span>
                        No.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <b>ICE tokens can only be acquired by locking AQUA.</b> If someone is
                        offering ICE tokens on Stellar, they are fake. ICE tokens have the domain
                        <i> aqua.network</i>.

            <Question
                question={'Why is my ICE balance going down?'}
                answer={
                    <span>
                        ICE tokens melt as the AQUA unlocking date gets closer. Every day, the
                        protocol claws back ICE from your wallet balance and the votes you have
                        made. This means your balance and votes will decline over time unless more
                        AQUA is frozen.

            <Question
                question={'Can I avoid ICE balance declines?'}
                answer={
                    <span>
                        Locking more AQUA can bring your ICE balance back up.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Alternatively, ICE balance declines can be temporarily avoided by locking
                        for longer than 3 years. As the 10 times boost maxes out at 3 year locks, a
                        lock of 4 years will see no ICE balance declines for one year. Once the lock
                        enters the last 3 years, ICE will decline accordingly.

            <Question
                question={'How does locking work & is it safe?'}
                answer={
                    <span>
                        Locking AQUA takes place entirely at the protocol level on Stellar. When you
                        use the tool above, a claimable balance is created and sent back to your
                        wallet. Only you can reclaim the locked AQUA balance, unfreezing ICE after
                        the lock period you select passes.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Locking AQUA is completely safe when using this tool. AQUA is securely
                        locked into the Stellar blockchain, with only you able to reclaim the tokens
                        at a later time.
