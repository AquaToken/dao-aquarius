        <h2>Is information about me secure?</h2>
        <p>
            We seek to protect Personal Data to ensure that it is kept private; however, we cannot
            guarantee the security of any Personal Data. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or
            software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at
            any time.
        </p>
        <p>
            We maintain technical, physical, and administrative security measures to protect the
            security of your Personal Data against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure,
            and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls, data encryption, physical
            access controls to our data centers, and information access authorization controls. We
            do not guarantee or warrant that such techniques will prevent unauthorized access to
            information about you that we store, Personal Data or otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, we limit access to your Personal Data to those employees, agents,
            contractors, and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only
            process your Personal Data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of
            confidentiality.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected Personal Data breach and will
            notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do
            so.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is your responsibility to make sure that your Personal Data is accurate and that your
            password(s), private keys, and account registration information are secure and not
            shared with third-parties. We cannot assist in recovery of the loss of private keys.
        </p>

        <h2>How long will you use my personal data for?</h2>
        <p>
            We will only retain your Personal Data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill
            the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal,
            regulatory, tax, accounting, or reporting requirements. We may retain your Personal Data
            for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a
            prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
        </p>
        <p>
            To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount,
            nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from
            unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process
            your Personal Data, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and
            the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or other requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            By law we have to keep basic information about our customers for six years after they
            cease being customers.

            for further information.
        </p>
        <p>
            In some circumstances we will anonymize your Personal Data (so that it can no longer be
            associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this
            information indefinitely without further notice to you.
