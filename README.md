<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Aquarius is designed to supercharge trading on Stellar, bring more liquidity and give control over how it is distributed across various market pairs. It adds incentives for SDEX traders ("market maker rewards") and rewards for AMM liquidity providers. Aquarius allows community to set rewards for selected markets through on-chain voting.

#### What is DAO Aquarius?
The end goal is to build a thriving, reliable and decentralized ecosystem around Aquarius and AQUA tokens. Key protocol parameters will be controlled by the AQUA token holders. This will be further explored as the smart contract frameworks on Stellar mature and evolve.

#### How does governance work?
Community users can create proposals to be voted on by the AQUA community. When created, a proposal author will choose an end date for voting on their proposal. The AQUA community has until the end of voting to decide if they would like to vote for or against the proposal.

#### What is Aquarius voting?
Aquarius allows the community of AQUA holders to signal where liquidity is needed through a voting process. This introduces an additional liquidity management layer for the whole Stellar network.

AQUA token holders decide on the market pairs where liquidity is needed most, and also define the size of market maker rewards for each pair.

#### How does voting work?
The voting happens on-chain so the votes can be independently validated by any user. Aquarius provides an interface visualising the votes and current rewards in various markets, as well as a separate dashboard where AQUA holders can vote. Voting works with most Stellar wallets including hardware wallets such as Ledger.

After each round of voting, Aquarius aggregates the individual votes of all Stellar users. Based on the results it defines a list of markets where the incentives should be activated.
